# historyquiz
Simple History Quizz i made using HMTL, CSS, JQuery, Javascript.


Had a little but if trouble when i was trying to figure out how to loop through the options and questions, took me awhile and a far bite of using google.  while i added the score and the quiz number had some weird bugs where it was adding 1 then it starting adding 2. that was a small bug that was fixed pretty easy.
